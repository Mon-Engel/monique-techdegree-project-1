        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am an experienced Graphic Designer with a BA Graphic Design Degree. I have a passion and technical flair for design. Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience and skills that range from advertising, designing marketing material, and creating website interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            I take great pride in the work I design. I always strive to deliver an effective, on-target product that fits my clients' needs and goals. I am a proactive, creative thinker with high values, excellent energy levels, hard-working, and an unwavering commitment to meet my deadlines. I work well under pressure and consider myself to be a strong communicator, presenter, and listener with a fine eye for detail.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My overall goal is to take my Graphic Design skills to the next level by adding Front End Developer to my resume.</p>
        <p>I hope to gain more knowledge and a better understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and, in this process, be able to create engaging and interactive websites by learning how to master technical development tools such as:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These additional skills will not only benefit me but also add value to the team I work for at KAUST by being better equipped to take on and assist with future web development projects.</p>
