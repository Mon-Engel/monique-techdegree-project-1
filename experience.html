          <h3 class="marg-blk-btm-0">Senior Graphic Designer</h3>
          <p class="subtitle">May 2012 - May 2018</p>

          <p>
            I was a UI&sol;UX designer responsible for the transference of the client's brand visual assets to the virtual tour interface, making sure the design is consistent, and the layout is an attractive, guided, and responsive interactive experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was able to implement the visual elements into the web application by learning how to code with HTML, XML, and CSS. It was an excellent opportunity for me to expand my skills, and through hard work, I became the design team lead.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also assisted the marketing team by creating any promotional materials such as designing social media posts, LED scoreboard branded video ads, promotional web banners, etc.
